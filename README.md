Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in both lungs. It is one of the leading causes of death in Singapore and worldwide. Accounting for 20.7%, 18.8% and 18.4% of deaths in Singapore in 2019,2020 and 2021 according to the death statistics retrieve from HealthHub. As for worldwide, statistics has shown that 2.5 million people have died from pneumonia in 2019.<br/>

## Problem Statement
**How might we detect pneumonia for doctors in order to increase the effeciency and accuracy of diagnosis?** <br/><br/>
As normal examination and detection of pneumonia takes a period of time and requires human supervision. We decided to use machine learning to find a way to help to increase the efficiency, reduce the amount of manpower needed and improve diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia.

<br/>
The dataset that we have picked is <b>Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)</b> (Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
<br><br>
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
<br><br>
All Chest X-ray images were select from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou.
